193.  120 Americans die every day from drug overdoses - most involving legal prescription drugs. That's more than from car crashes.

201.  We have a moral responsibility to do what we can for families forced from their homes. Find out how you can help at http://t.co/J8A6mTD6D4.
202.  But this isn't just about what I can do as President. Every single one of us - from citizens to NGOs - can help refugees find safe haven.
203.  We're also increasing the number of Syrian and other refugees we admit to the U.S. to 100,000 per year for the next two years.
204.  We've provided more than $4.5 billion in humanitarian aid to help meet the needs of those impacted by the Syrian conflict.
205.  Nearly 12 million people have been displaced by the conflict in Syria. As Americans, we can't sit idly by. That's not who we are.
206.  I'm grateful for the teachers who helped spark my sense of curiosity. The #62MillionGirls who aren't in school should have that same chance.
207.  Yogi Berra was an American original - a Hall of Famer, jovial prophet, & a humble veteran. We'll miss you, Yogi, but your legacy ain't over.
208.  Welcome to the White House, @Pontifex! Your messages of love, hope, and peace have inspired us all.
209.  Millions of families are more secure thanks to the ACA. Join them and #GetCovered on Nov 1: http://t.co/PJ7xIL6FjY  https://t.co/GF6yS0aHol
210.  Our right to vote is sacred. It's the foundation of our democracy. You can find out how to register to vote at http://t.co/8kaqY0U3fn.
211.  Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.
212.  We've fought back because of you. We shouldn't slip back because of Congress. I urge them to send me a budget that invests in our future.
213.  When I took office, the budget deficit had reached 9.2% of our GDP. We've cut that down to 2.8%. http://t.co/3viaw4b0bB
214.  When I took office, 15.4% of our population was uninsured. Today, we’ve cut that by more than a third. http://t.co/3OOqcz8Oxp
215.  In 2009, our auto industry was flatlining. Now our workers are on pace to sell more American cars and trucks than any year since 2001.
216.  We've cut the unemployment rate in half – from a high of 10% down to 5.1%. And we're not done. http://t.co/uRfaSoiGuA
217.  When I took office, 800,000 Americans lost their jobs each month. Our businesses have now added 13.1 million jobs over 66 straight months.
218.  7 years ago today, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, setting off the worst financial crisis in decades. Here's how far we've come:
219.  "@FAFSA" might be hard to say, but filling it out can help you pay for college. FLOTUS, you're up! #5TimesFAFSA http://t.co/y1Jv8aeGUH
220.  14 years after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, we honor those we lost. We salute all who serve to keep us safe. We stand as strong as ever.
221.  Today's Senate vote on the Iran deal is a historic step toward preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The world is safer for it.
222.  Thank you, Colin, for putting your experience and expertise behind this important initiative for our country. https://t.co/bSnaLMs8CU
223.  I loved Alaska and met so many inspiring people. Have to keep up the fight on climate change for their sake—and ours. http://t.co/HzWW0S6iQc
224.  Today we’re returning Mount McKinley to its native name - Denali, a step to reflect the heritage of Alaska Natives. http://t.co/WyzQImKymX
225.  In Treme, I was inspired by the progress & people 10 years after Katrina. It gives us hope, but our work isn't done. http://t.co/LDqsARhnZt
226.  Amidst global volatility, Congress should protect the momentum of our growing economy (not kill it). We must avoid shutdown / austerity.
227.  The National Park Service: 99 years and 84 million acres strong. Congrats to all who work to protect these treasures. http://t.co/R8RyB9vkVW
228.  President Carter is as good a man as they come. Michelle and I are praying for him and Rosalynn. We're all pulling for you, Jimmy.
229.  Due to popular request, here are my vacation playlists: http://t.co/uer5sIl4Vk http://t.co/zHEekHvQBr What's your favorite summer song?
230.  RT @JohnKerry: Pleased to be in #Havana for historic day @USEmbCuba. Incredible: last time #SecState visited #Cuba, FDR was @POTUS. http://…
231.  Thank you for all you've done to protect our sacred right to vote. It's as important today as it's ever been. https://t.co/ge74wu5nc1
232.  Heroes like @RepJohnLewis, Dr. King, and countless others sacrificed so that all of our voices could be heard. http://t.co/L7kxtWQlYW
233.  Before 1965, African Americans faced poll taxes, literacy tests, or having to count jellybeans in a jar when they tried to register to vote.
234.  50 years ago today, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, securing the right to vote for millions of African Americans.
235.  Pretty incredible time lapse of the dark side of the moon passing Earth from @NASA. American ingenuity at work! http://t.co/JKep9bcxGQ
236.  Important detail – there are no secret deals. My staff can brief you on any question about any part of the deal. https://t.co/UO0B5xCOPh
237.  The choice is ultimately between diplomacy and war. Iran's nuclear program accelerates if Congress kills this deal. https://t.co/nvBeO1Omko
238.  It's the strongest nuclear deal ever negotiated. There's no such thing as a "better deal." Walking away risks war. https://t.co/la7GhQXfzl
239.  I refuse to condemn our kids to a planet that's beyond fixing. Let's meet this challenge and #ActOnClimate together.
240.  Despite what the critics will tell you, this plan will ultimately save the average American family nearly $85 a year on their energy bills.
241.  Thanks to this plan, there will be 90,000 fewer asthma attacks among our kids and we'll avoid 3,600 premature deaths in 2030.
242.  It's time to change that. With the Clean Power Plan, by 2030, carbon pollution from power plants will be 32% lower than it was a decade ago.
243.  Right now, power plants account for about one-third of America’s carbon pollution. That’s more than our cars, airplanes, and homes combined.
244.  Levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are higher than they’ve been in 800,000 years. 2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record.
245.  Today, we're announcing America's Clean Power Plan—the most important step we've ever taken to combat climate change. Here are the facts:
246.  Hey @StationCDRKelly, loving the photos. Do you ever look out the window and just freak out?
247.  Launching a pilot program to help students in prison pay for college, because everyone willing to work for it deserves a second chance.
248.  Happy 50th birthday, Medicare and Medicaid! Two programs, one promise: that every American deserves a basic measure of dignity and security.
249.  25 years of the ADA and Americans with disabilities are breaking more barriers than ever, making all of us more free. Let's keep going.
250.  Proud to be the first American President to visit Kenya. Happy to see family, and to talk with young Kenyans about the future.
251.  E.L. Doctorow was one of America's greatest novelists. His books taught me much, and he will be missed.
252.  RT @TheIranDeal: The historic #IranDeal succeeds in verifying that Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon. Follow to get the facts: http://t.c…
253.  Just got this new blue marble photo from @NASA. A beautiful reminder that we need to protect the only planet we have. http://t.co/JQ3174P0LF

256.  Pluto just had its first visitor! Thanks @NASA - it's a great day for discovery and American leadership. http://t.co/FfztBSMbK0
257.  Good conversation with Tom Friedman on the deal we reached with Iran. It's a major step toward a safer world.  https://t.co/xwSrH9IoFG
258.  Mass incarceration doesn't work. Let's build communities that give kids a shot at success and prisons that prepare people for a 2nd chance.
259.  We could eliminate tuition at every public college and university in America with the $80 billion we spend each year on incarcerations.
260.  The $80 billion we spend each year on incarcerations could double the salary of every high school teacher in America.
261.  The $80 billion we spend each year to keep people incarcerated could pay for universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America.
262.  In 1980, there were 500,000 people in American jails. Today, there are 2.2 million. Many belong. But too many are nonviolent offenders.
263.  America keeps more people behind bars than the top 35 European countries combined.
264.  America is home to 5% of the world's population, but 25% of the world's prisoners.
265.  Just spoke to the NAACP about criminal justice reform, something many broadly agree on. Some stats:
266.  South Carolina taking down the confederate flag - a signal of good will and healing, and a meaningful step towards a better future.
267.  What a win for Team USA! Great game @CarliLloyd! Your country is so proud of all of you. Come visit the White House with the World Cup soon.
268.  http://t.co/Ft3DwYWRJv
269.  It doesn't get much better than celebrating America with the people you love. Happy Fourth of July, everyone!

292.  So inspired by the grace shown by the Simmons family and all the victims' families in Charleston. #HateWontWin http://t.co/jMS0SDUYui
293.  Today is a big step in our march toward equality. Gay and lesbian couples now have the right to marry, just like anyone else. #LoveWins
294.  The uninsured rate is the lowest it's ever been. Let's keep at it until every American has quality, affordable health insurance.
295.  More than 137 million Americans have guaranteed access to preventive care like cancer screenings and birth control at no out-of-pocket cost.
296.  Women can no longer be charged more for health coverage just for being women.
297.  129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied health coverage.
298.  More than 16 million Americans have gained health coverage after 5 years of the Affordable Care Act.
299.  Today's decision is a victory for every hardworking American. Access to quality, affordable health care is a right, not a privilege.
300.  Good luck Team USA – make us proud out there! #OneNationOneTeam http://t.co/btu3dRXPbr
